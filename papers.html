<h3><a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001911">Nonato, Rafael. 2013. Clitic deletion and the morphology/phonology interface.
Ms. 6/Sep/2013</a></h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This paper identifies a deletion phenomenon in Kĩsêdjê and discusses it within the framework of Optimal Interleaving (Wolf 2008). In order to account for the Kĩsêdjê phenomenon, I have to formalize an aspect of Wolf's system that is left vague in his original formulation, namely, the size of the domain that is input to morphophonological evaluation. I conclude that morphophonology evaluates abstract prosodic phrases.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001912">Nonato, Rafael. 2013. Clause chaining is asymmetric vP coordination. Ms. 6/Aug/2013</a></h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>A wealth of work in functional-typological linguistics posits a sui generis construction called “clause chaining”, attributing various specific properties to it (see for instance Dooley (2010a,b) and the works cited therein). In this paper I argue that the special notion of clause chaining is epiphenomenal. Once a few independent language-specific properties are factored out, the construction is indistinguishable from asymmetric vP coordination</p>

<h3><a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001909">Nonato, Rafael. 2008. Ainore Boe egore: um 
estudo descritivo da língua bororo e conseqüências para a teoria de caso e concordância. 
Master thesis, UNICAMP - Brazil</a></h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Bororo has around 700 speakers, living in five villages in the region of Rondonópolis, MT. It 
is the last living language of the Bororoan family (the others, according to Kaufman (1994) were 
Umutina, whose last speaker died recently, Otuké, and a supposed dialect called West Bororo).</p>
<p>This dissertation begins with a brief introduction (section 1) and a summary of the activities 
developed in the field (section 2). After that, it concentrates on its two main subjects: in the first 
part (section 3), it is a descriptive grammar of Bororo and, in the second (section 4), it proposes a 
theoretical model based on the data from this language. At last, it includes three appendixes: a 
Bororo-Portuguese lexicon (Appendix 1), the sentences elicited in the field (Appendix 2) and the 
stories collected and analyzed (Appendix 3).</p>
<p>The grammar in section 3 employs mostly the terms from the grammar tradition that comes 
from the Greeks. Symbolism of the generative grammar is used only in some parts that it allowed 
to present in a more elegant a precise way.</p>
<p>The model presented in the second part of this dissertation is based on the theory sketched in 
Chomsky (2000, 2001). Given the evidence that this theory doesn't account for the phenomena of 
case, agreement and movement of Bororo, some revisions are proposed in order to, essentially, 
rescue head movement to the syntax (head movement had been left to PF by Chomsky 2001), 
linking it explicatively to the phenomena of case and agreement and argument movement. Besides 
accounting for the data of an ergative active language as Bororo, this model is extended to other 
systems of case and agreement (ergative and accusative alike) and explains Holmberg 
Generalization.</p>

Revista da Abralin. v. 6, n. 1</a></h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Chomsky (2000, 2001) delineates a theory of case, agreement and movement that leaves head
movement to phonological computation. I propose changes to this theory that rescue head movement
to the syntax, explanatorily connecting it to the facts of case and agreement (of different ergative
and accusative systems) and argument movement.</p>
